# Day_03 - GitHub, AI Concepts, WSL, and Kali Linux Basics

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is GitHub?

- A platform for hosting and managing code using **Git** version control.
- Enables collaboration, code sharing, version tracking, and project management.
- Key features: repositories, branches, commits, pull requests, issues, forks.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Vibe Coding

- A coding platform or community where developers collaborate, learn, and share.
- Encourages live or collaborative coding experiences.
- Focuses on coding practice, pair programming, or guided coding sessions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Humana.ai

- AI-powered tool/platform (mentioned in the session).
- Typically involves use cases like AI-assisted coding, decision making, or automation.
- Helps developers or users leverage artificial intelligence in projects.

---

## ðŸ“Œ .md Files and README Files

- **`.md` files** = Markdown files.
- Used for formatting text with headers, lists, links, code blocks, etc.
- Commonly used for documentation in software projects.
- **README.md**: Main file in a GitHub repo that explains project purpose, usage, setup, and documentation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ MCP Server in AI

- MCP = **Multi-Channel Processor (or Controller)** (context specific depending on AI system).
- In AI, could refer to backend servers that manage multiple AI models or data channels.
- Used to process large-scale data and coordinate AI tasks.

---

## ðŸ“Œ RaginAI

- Likely a tool or platform discussed for AI processing or automation.
- May focus on tasks such as data handling, model training, or decision automation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Forking Repository in GitHub

- **Fork** = Create a personal copy of someone else's repository.
- Allows experimenting, contributing, or making changes independently.
- Changes can be merged back into original repo via Pull Requests.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Running Kali Linux as Application on Windows using WSL

- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** allows running Linux inside Windows.
- You can install Kali Linux directly via WSL without creating a VM.
- Uses Windows Kernel to bridge Linux system calls.

---

## ðŸ“Œ KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)

- Linux-based virtualization technology.
- Converts Linux into a type-1 hypervisor.
- Allows running multiple virtual machines with good performance.
- Often used for advanced cybersecurity labs.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Buffer Overflow

- Security vulnerability where a program writes more data than buffer can hold.
- Can lead to system crashes, data corruption, or allow attackers to execute malicious code.
- A common exploit technique studied in ethical hacking.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Kali Linux Commands (Basic)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sudo` | Run commands as superuser (root privileges). |
| `cd` | Change directory. |
| `ls` | List files and directories. |
| `pwd` | Print working directory. |
| `rm` | Remove files or directories. |
| `mkdir` | Create new directory. |
| `apt update` | Update package list. |
| `apt upgrade` | Upgrade installed packages. |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Root Directory

- Represented as `/` in Linux systems.
- Top-level directory containing all system files, configurations, and subdirectories.
- Only accessible fully by root or sudo users.
