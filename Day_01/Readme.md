# Day_01 - Introduction to Cybersecurity

## ðŸ“Œ What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It ensures:

- Confidentiality of data
- Integrity of information
- Availability of systems and services

---

## ðŸ“Œ What We Do in Cybersecurity

- Identify security risks and vulnerabilities
- Implement security measures and controls
- Monitor and respond to incidents
- Perform ethical hacking and penetration testing
- Conduct forensic investigations after attacks
- Educate users on safe practices

## ðŸ“Œ Reel vs Real in Cybersecurity

| Reel (Myth) | Real (Fact) |
|--------------|-------------|
| Hackers wear hoodies and type fast | Cybersecurity is more about analysis, strategy, and patience |
| Instant hacking | Real-world attacks often take days, weeks, or months |
| Hacking is always illegal | Ethical hacking (penetration testing) is legal and essential |
| One person handles all security | Cybersecurity is a team effort involving multiple roles |

## ðŸ“Œ Cybersecurity is Important For:

- Individuals (protect personal data, privacy)
- Businesses (protect financial data, intellectual property)
- Governments (national security, critical infrastructure)
- Healthcare (patient records, medical devices)
- Financial Institutions (banking systems, transactions)
- Education (student data, research information)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Types of Cybersecurity Threats

- Malware (Viruses, Worms, Ransomware, Spyware)
- Phishing Attacks
- Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
- Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- SQL Injection
- Insider Threats
- Zero-Day Exploits
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)

## ðŸ“Œ Red Team vs Purple Team vs Blue Team

| Team | Role |
|------|------|
| **Red Team** | Offensive security - simulates attacks to identify weaknesses |
| **Blue Team** | Defensive security - protects, monitors, and responds to threats |
| **Purple Team** | Collaborative approach - combines Red and Blue Teams to improve security |
