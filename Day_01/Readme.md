# Day 01 - Cybersecurity Session: Ethical Hacking

## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

## 3 Domains in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is broadly classified into three main domains:

- **Blue Team (Defensive Security)**: Focuses on defending and protecting systems from attacks.
- **Red Team (Offensive Security)**: Focuses on simulating attacks to test the security posture.
- **Purple Team (Combined Security)**: A collaboration between Red and Blue teams to improve security through shared knowledge.
