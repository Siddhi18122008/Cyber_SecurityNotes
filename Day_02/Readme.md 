- Can cause huge financial loss and data breaches.

### 3️⃣ Malware
- Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access.
- Includes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, adware, and ransomware.

### 4️⃣ Social Engineering
- Psychological manipulation to trick people into revealing confidential information.
- Examples: pretexting, baiting, tailgating.

### 5️⃣ Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM)
- Attacker secretly intercepts and alters communication between two parties.
- Used for data theft, eavesdropping, and injecting malicious content.

### 6️⃣ Zero-Day Attack
